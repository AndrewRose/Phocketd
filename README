Phocketd

Phocket is a PHP7 OOP implementation of a Websockets Server.  It uses the PHP Event extension and is secured using TLS.  Any number of observers can be written to consume requests based on common URL routing.

Developed with these great resources:

I also use the PHP HTTP extension for reading the clients upgrade headers:
